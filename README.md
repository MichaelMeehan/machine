## Overview

Welcome to the Machine.

## Setup

This section is meant to help you with setting up an optimized environment for this course and assumes you are on Windows. If you have better alternatives for the programs below, feel free to use them or post them here - this case, please note that we will not discuss problems with setting up your own preferred environment during the meetings (troubleshooting would take forever) and simply assume you know what you are doing.

Download and setup the following infrastructure with default options:

1. [Pycharm Community 2019.1](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
2. [Anaconda (latest)](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
3. [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)

#### Pycharm
***

Pycharm is a super powerful Python IDE. You are all eligible to get the educational version for free, and I would recommend doing so - it has funky things like deployment, which makes project deployment to remote servers a lot easier (e.g. to run your code on GPU). It also has inbuilt linting support along PEP guidelines, so if you make an effort to get rid of squiggly lines in the IDE, your code will look like real Python! Wow, so cool.

#### Anaconda
***

Anaconda started out as an alternative to the `PyPI` package manager for Python. However, it has become a versatile and robust package manager, providing access to other command line programs not necessarily based on Python. If you are still installing most programs from source, stop everything you're doing and use Anaconda. Seriously.

#### Git Bash
***

Git Bash is a pretty convenient way to have a somewhat functional UNIX terminal on your Windows. There are alternatives with more functionality, but this is not necessary most of the time. You should not expect the terminal to operate exactly the same as on UNIX systems, simply because a ton of basic command line programs shipping with UNIX systems are not available for Windows.


## Weekly Tasks
